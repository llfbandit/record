## 5.0.0
* Chore:
    * Massively reworked platform implementations.
    * Android now uses MediaCodec. Package is now written with kotlin (well...).
    * iOS, macOS code now shares almost the same codebase. Unified under record_darwin package.
    * Windows now uses MediaFoundation shipped with all 10 & 11 versions (no more fmedia executable, yeah! Even if do appreciate the work of stsaz).

* Features:
    * feat: Add multiple instance support.
    * feat: Add PCM streaming feature & AAC on Android only.
    * feat: Add auto gain control, noise suppressor and echo cancellation where available.
    * feat: Add amplitude on web (Thanks to [youssefali424](https://github.com/youssefali424)).
    * feat: Add best effort to adjust sample and bit rates to supported values (Android, iOS, macOS).
    * feat: Add `cancel()` method to stop and remove file if any.

* Fix:
    * iOS: Should pause/resume recording when interrupted by the system.
    * web: Add duration metadata to created blob (Thanks to [youssefali424](https://github.com/youssefali424)).

* Breaking changes:
    * BREAK: `Record` has been renamed to `AudioRecorder` to avoid confusion with dart v3.
    * BREAK: path is now required on all IO platforms. Set an empty String on web platform.
    There no more temp file generation.
    * BREAK: `start` and `startStream` method parameters are now wrapped in `RecordConfig` object.
    * BREAK: `samplingRate` has been renamed to `sampleRate`.
    * BREAK: vorbis support has been removed. Too few underlying support.

## 5.0.0-beta.3+1
* fix: Amplitude timer is not restarted for subsequent recordings.
* chore: Allow UUID v3 & V4.

## 5.0.0-beta.3
* fix: Adding events to amplitude stream after close

## 5.0.0-beta.2
* chore: remove `pcm8bit`. Virtually still available since we have pcm 16 bits.
* chore: throw exception when encoder is not supported.
* fix(web): Multiple issues on web platform.
* fix: Other minor fixes.
* feat(web): Add WAVE encoder support (16 bits).
* feat: add utility method `convertBytesToInt16` to convert Uint8List to signed int 16 bits.

## 5.0.0-beta.1
**Testers needed to reach release !**
